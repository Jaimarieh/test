        <b>Josh:</b> 1970s fashion is often known for the rise of diso mivement which introduced nore glamorous styles. However, it wasn't just that. There was various culture rises that encompassed and created various styles. <br><br>
        <b>Josh:</b> For me my style is a spin-off of the rise in rock and punk culture. Bands like the sex pistols and Led Zeppelin influences eddy rebellious styles. <br><br>
        <b>Josh:</b> For example, ripped jeans, leather jackets, and studded accessories. While my outfit isnt currently like that I grabbed insporation from that current trend and turned it into my own style. </p>
